# Portfolio v0.2

This is my second iteartion of my professional portfolio. It contains links to my portfolio pieces as well as new blog posts and projects that were in active development. This format is now deprecated - the newest iteration can be found at http://www.q8z8p.com.

It is a more feature rich version of my original portfolio.

## Motivation

My previous blog had personally fun and interesting, but I wanted a cleaner and more professional appearance. I also wanted to start at least one blog post so that I could publish my blog and advertise to a few people online.

## Features

Overall clean appearance with consistent color palette.

SPA (Single Page Application) with top bar navigation.

Home Page has links to social media and popup for email.

Home Page has animation popin/popout for resume.

About Page has "Kodak" picture modal on timer with arrows (arrows animated).

Projects Page has slider overlay for each picture/project.

Blog page has 2 blogs (one in development); Algorithms Blog (small) and Google Refinance (big).

Contact Page emails directly.

## Technologies Used

React w/React Router

Flexbox

Several Animation Libraries (Velocity, React-Motion, Processing.js)
